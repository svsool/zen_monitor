defmodule ZenMonitor.Local.Dispatcher do
  @moduledoc """
  `ZenMonitor.Local.Dispatcher` is a GenStage Consumer responsible for throttled delivery of down
  messages.

  `ZenMonitor.Local` acts as a GenStage Producer, it stores all of the down messages that need to
  be dispatched based off of what has been enqueued by the `ZenMonitor.Local.Connector`.

  The Dispatcher will deliver these messages throttled by a maximum rate which is controlled by
  the {:zen_monitor, :demand_interval} and {:zen_monitor, :demand_amount} settings.

  To calculate the maximum number of messages processed per second you can use the following
  formula:

  maximum_mps = (demand_amount) * (1000 / demand_interval)

  For example, if the demand_amount is 1000, and demand_interval is 100 (milliseconds) the maximum
  messages per second are:

  maximum_mps = (1000) * (1000 / 100)
             -> (1000) * 10
             -> 10_000

  For convenience a `ZenMonitor.Local.Dispatcher.maximum_mps/0` is provided that will perform this
  calculation.

  Handles the events for dispatch

  Dispatch is a simple two step procedure followed for each message to be dispatched.

  1.  Check if the message is still valid.  Messages can become invalid if the monitor was
      demonitored after the message was enqueued.

  2a.  If valid:  forward the message to the subscriber
  2b.  If invalid: skip message

  Event dispatch will calculate an "unfulfilled" demand based off the number of messages skipped
  and demand that the producer provide additional events so that MPS is maintained and prevent the
